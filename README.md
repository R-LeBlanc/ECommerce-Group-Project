# Reservoir Cats 

In this project we had to work as a group, using everything we have learned in the course, to create a wearable e-commerce website that will showcase all of the provided _wearables_ items.

Uses full MERN stack.

The node server is RESTful and follows REST principles.

No external UI libraries were allowed.

## MVP

### Frontend

Users are able to

- View all items in the _database_.
- Purchase items that are in stock.
- View a cart containing the items they intend to purchase.
- Edit cart before completing the purchase.

### Backend Requirements

The Node server is

- RESTful.
- Provides the FE with the required data in a clear and organized way.
- Updates the _database_ as users make purchases.

### Stretch Goals

- The user can search the store for items based on various criteria from the dropdown menus.
- The filters stack with one another, narrowing down the search.
- The filters can then be cleared.
